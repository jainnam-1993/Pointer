Pointer delivers daily non-dual awareness pointings from diverse wisdom traditions.

Unlike meditation apps that guide you through practices, Pointer offers direct pointings—immediate invitations to recognize your true nature, right now.

FEATURES

PHILOSOPHY
Pointer takes an anti-meditation stance. Rather than building a practice over time, each pointing is a direct invitation to recognize what you already are.
