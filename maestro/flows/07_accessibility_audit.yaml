# Accessibility Audit Flow - Screen reader element verification
# Run: maestro test maestro/flows/07_accessibility_audit.yaml
#
# Purpose: Document which UI elements are accessible
# Limitation: Maestro can tap elements but can't verify semantic labels
# Note: Keep Flutter accessibility_test.dart for WCAG compliance verification
#
# This flow replaces: adb_test_helper.sh list_elements, ios_test_helper.sh list
