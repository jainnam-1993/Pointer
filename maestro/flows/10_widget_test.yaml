# Widget Test - Verify home screen widget loads content correctly
# Run: maestro test maestro/flows/10_widget_test.yaml
#
# Purpose: Catch widget loading failures (e.g., "Tap to load" empty state)
# Requires: Widget must be added to home screen before running
# Duration: ~60 seconds
#
# FAILURE SCENARIOS THIS TEST CATCHES:
# - Widget shows "Tap to load" instead of pointing content
# - Widget cache not populated by app
# - RemoteViewsService/Factory data loading failure
# - Widget theme mismatch (dark/light mode sync issues)
#
# SETUP: Add the Pointer widget to your home screen before running this test
# The widget should be visible without scrolling on the home screen
